      message: `It's very rare to find an amazing talent being humble. We donâ€™t come across such people in life. Santosh is one such amazing person, who has a big heart and superficial tech talent. <br /><br />
      As an earlier team mate, In every conversation of ours, he used to give assurance to me, that He is there to handle things. That affirmation doesn't come as a statement, but in the form of the breaking down things we are supposed to do and detailing things and accomplishing them. As a founder who is paving the path in dark, know what kind of assurance those qualities give. One more special quality to mention is the ability to get things done super fast. The quickness and accuracy are definitely his skills to boast. <br /><br />
      His work ethic, super efficient task completions, ideations to the team regarding the product, voluntary support and more importantly his humble team mate attitude make him stand tall. <strong>We are lucky to have him on our side!</strong>`,

This perfection is only achieved by a few people across globe I guess & takes years to practice and master.<br /><br />Through this I mean, this guy can work on 2 problems at the same time.. Any company should be more than happy and beneficial to have an employee to solve their 2 problems at one time, with perfection.. For this you'll need to hire him right away. His designing skills on web page development are awesome`,

He would be a great talent to work with and happy to learn together.`,
